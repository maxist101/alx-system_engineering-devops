## Requirements

General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it wonâ€™t throw an exception if the key doesnâ€™t exist in the dictionary)
- Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":)

## Learning Objectives


At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
- What Bash scripting should not be used for
- What is an API
- What is a REST API
- What are microservices
- What is the CSV format
- What is the JSON format
- Pythonic Package and module name style
- Pythonic Class name style
- Pythonic Variable name style
- Pythonic Function name style
- Pythonic Constant name style
- Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
